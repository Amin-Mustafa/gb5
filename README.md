# gb5 - Gameboy Emulator in C++

## Building
Requires gcc 8 or higher. If you have an installation of make, download the zip file and call 
    ```
    make
    ```
to build. Note that this requires a Unix-like build environment, such as with MSYS2.
You could also manually compile all source and include files with gcc directly, but make sure to use 
    ```
    -std=c++20
    ```
